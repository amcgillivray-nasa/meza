    Fix database backup function
    
    Quote mysql password option to avoid special characters being interpreted by the Ansible shell module.
    
    In the source_wiki_exists_check task of /src/roles/remote-mysqldump/tasks/main.yml:104 you could
    end up with a command like the following:
    mysqlshow -u wiki_app_user -p6K2s9n!XTtebd$GUfy$8YtGVIcZYXA@d wiki_test3 | grep -v Wildcard | grep -o wiki_test3\n
    
    The password has ! and $ in it - both shell special characters. https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/SpecialCharacters
    
    We avoid interpretation by quoting the password value with single quotes.

    fix: load balancer variable naming
    
    Commit 45c7cb04 changed how load balancer groups are accessed. This was
    a good change, but some of the load balancer variables were changed
    accidentally. e.g.
    
    load_balancers_nonmeza --> load_balancers_meza_nonmeza
    
    This "_meza_nonmeza" ending (a) was applied inconsistently and (b)
    doesn't make sense as a naming convention.
    
    This commit fixes naming.
